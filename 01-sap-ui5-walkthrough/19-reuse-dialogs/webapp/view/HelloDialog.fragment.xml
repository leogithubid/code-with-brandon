<!-- Let's create a fragment.xml and then add a Dialog inside it
     This Fragment will be called from Hello Panel view
     By instantiating it in its controller 
     Dialog has an aggregation beginButton, so let's use that and place a close button
     We added an icon with aggregation core:Icon, we could do that because Dialog has a
     default aggregation called content, hence we don't have to write <conten>
